	<h3>1.What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"? </h3>
<h4>
	Lialina contradicts her idea to Norman by arguing that the word “user” still needs to be considered not “people”. For example, she supposes that naming as people instead of users hides the existence of two classes of people; developers and users. She even points out that users may lose their rights and the opportunity to protect them when not being called users. She thinks the word “user” is very crucial for perceiving and designing what users need and therefore having a better system for the users. She states that meaning of to be user should be better understood.

	<h3>2. What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</h3>
<h4>
Lialina’s ideal internet user is “general purpose users” who are not professional at programming and understanding computers – who are busy with something else. She outlines the Universal user and explains that <em>“there can be different examples and levels that users can imagine for themselves, but the capacity to be universal is still in all of us”. </em>
She means that the general purpose users interact with the app or online system by their own way, for their own purposes such as using Live Journal as if it is Twitter. She stresses out that the general purpose users are the one who are the ultimate participants of “man-computer symbiosis”.

	<h3>3.From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?</h3>
<h4>
One example from my experience where there were “gaps that can be filled by users”, was with buffering when watching an entertainment program. There was once this video uploaded on Youtube and had too much buffering which was wasting my time. To actually complete watching all the program, I opened a new tab, replayed the same video, and paused to the estimated time where there would be the buffering for the first video I was watching. When the buffering occurred, I went to that second tab and finished watching the entertainment program.
