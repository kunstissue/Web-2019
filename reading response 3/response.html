		<h1>Metaphor Defining The Behaviour of Websites </h1>
		<h2> Website is like human-being </h2>
		<p>
		 Website is imperfect. According to Laurel Schwulst, website "even has few bugs. But that's the beauty of it. Websites are living, temporal spaces". Likewsie, humans are imperfect. However, this could be seen as the beauty of human being. People fail, learn, and develop themselves to <em>self-improve</em>. One being imperfect also means that there is some potential to grow and develop within oneself.
		</p>

		<p>
		Here are some lists of description of metaphor for website in my opinion.</p>

		<p>
		<h3>Website itslef = society</h3>
		Website is like society. People get together and communicate each other within a topic.
		</p>

		<p>
		<h3>The design of a website = invidual style</h3>
		The design of a website is somewhat a style and appearance of oneself.
		</p>

		<p>
		<h3>Website Contents = One way of demonstrating individual thoughts & personality</h3>
		In other words, the words and contents of some personal websites show what one tries to message others in its own style within that text.
		</p>

		<p>
		<h3>Social Media Website = Celebrities</h3>
		For example, when something is wrong (websites = bugs), celebrities tend to get more criticism from the public. Moreover, like social media website gets profits due to the use of advertisement, celebirties earn a lot of money through it either.</p>
